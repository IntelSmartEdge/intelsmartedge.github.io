    <h3>Developer Experience Kit (22.03)</h3>
    <p>The 22.03 release of Intel® Smart Edge Open features an updated Developer Experience Kit.</p>
    <p>This release adds secure key management, management of virtual machines, and options for distributed storage.</p>
    <a class="uk-button uk-button-info uk-button-small uk-margin-small-bottom">Added</a>
    <h3>Secure key management</h3>
    <p>The Key Management Reference Application (KMRA) provides end-to-end protection of customer private keys at runtime by provisioning them into Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) enclaves.</p>
    <p>The application supports multitenancy by running multiple instances of Intel® SGX enclaves.</p>
    <p>The application also demonstrates how to integrate an Intel® SGX asymmetric key with a hardware security model (HSM) on a centralized key server. The reference application sets up an NGINX workload to access the private key in an Intel® SGX enclave on a 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor, using the PublicKey Cryptography Standard #11 interface and OpenSSL. It uses Intel® SGX Data Center Attestation Primitives libraries to generate and verify the ECDSA-signed Intel® SGX quote.</p>
    <h3>KubeVirt</h3>
    <p>This open-source project extends Kubernetes with Virtual Machine (VM) support via custom resource definitions (CRDs). It allows non-containerized applications and workloads inside VMs to be treated as Kubernetes managed workloads. This lets VM, container, and pod applications to coexist within a shared Kubernetes environment, supporting communication between Kubernetes pods, VMs, and services on the same cluster.</p>
    <h3>Rook-Ceph (storage orchestration solution)</h3>
    <p>Integrated the Rook-Ceph storage orchestration solution to provide distributed storage for edge applications. This allows storage to be automatically provisioned at the user’s request. It improves data reliability by distributing storage across the cluster, reducing the risk of creating a single point of failure.</p>
    <a class="uk-button uk-button-warning uk-button-small uk-margin-small-bottom">Known Issues</a>
    <h3>Edge Software Provisioner (ESP):</h3>
    <p>Occasionally, ESP fails to build the USB image and provisioning exits with an error. In this case, retry the ESP-based provisioning.</p>
    <p>Occasionally, ESP will build the image incorrectly and the target system – the system you are installing the edge node on – will fail to boot using the image. In this case, retry the ESP-based provisioning.</p>
    <p>Systems using legacy BIOS cannot boot from USB images. The target system must use a UEFI BIOS.</p>
    <h3>Intel® Security Libraries for Data Center (Intel® SecL-DC):</h3>
    <p>The Dell PowerEdge R750 TPM endorsement key is not signed by a known certificate authority. This causes the Intel® SecL-DC HVS application to fail to verify the TPM EK certificate. We are working on resolving this issue with Dell. As a workaround, the system administrator can provision the root CA certificate of the TPM endorsement key to HVS in out-of-band mode.</p>
    <p>The trust agent is unable to read the Platform Configuration Register (PCR) logs from Nationz TPM in Dell R750. This causes the trust agent to fail to generate the attestation with PCR measurements, which causes the HVS create_flavor API call to fail. This will be addressed in an upcoming release.</p>
    <h3>Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX):</h3>
    <p><strong>When</strong> an existing Intel® Provisioning Certification Caching Service (PCCS) deployment located on an AWS instance has been running for over 24 hours, provisioning a new DEK cluster may fail. If this occurs, reset Intel® SGX using the "SGX Factory Reset" option in the BIOS.</p>

    <p>This preview release is available to a pool of early customer adopters. The full experience kit, featuring a full SD-WAN implementation, will be released in the second quarter of 2022. You can <a href="/" title="browse the documentation">browse the documentation</a> for the preview release or <a href="/request-license" title="request a license">request a license</a> for the upcoming full release.</p>
    <a class="uk-button uk-button-info uk-button-small uk-margin-small-bottom">Added</a>
    <p>Remote Attestation for Trusted Computing: Support for remote attestation using the Intel&reg; Security Libraries for Data Center (<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/security-libraries-for-data-center-article.html?wapkw=security%20libraries" target="_blank" title="Intel&reg; SecL – DC" rel="nofollow">Intel&reg; SecL – DC</a>). Remote attestation is the foundation for trusted compute, providing verification of whether or not the operating system is trustworthy.</p>
    <p>Trusted application enclaves: Support for trusted application enclaves using Intel&reg; Software Guard Extensions (<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/cloud-computing/confidential-computing-sgx-video.html?wapkw=SGX" target="_blank" title="Intel&reg; SGX" rel="nofollow">Intel&reg; SGX</a>). Creates a secure execution environment and provides encryption for communication beyond the enclave boundary.</p>
    <p>Automated deployment: The Intel Edge Software Provisioning (ESP) tool has been added to automate the installation of the operating system and software stack on a bare-metal hardware platform. Deployment options include a SASE cloud cluster, a SASE POP (point of presence) cluster, or on a SASE edge cluster.</p>
    <a class="uk-button uk-button-warning uk-button-small uk-margin-small-bottom">Known Issues</a>
    <br><span>Edge Software Provisioner</span><br>
    <span>There are two known intermittent issues with the Edge Software Provisioner (ESP):</span>
    <ul>
        <li>The ESP occasionally fails to build the USB image and exits with an error.</li>
        <li>The ESP occasionally builds an incorrect image. In this case, the target system you are attempting to provision fails to boot.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Until we are able to provide a fix, the recommendation for both of these cases is to simply retry the process.</p>
    <p>The Edge Software Provisioner cannot boot USB images on machines that use a non-UEFI BIOS. Make sure that the system that will host the edge node has a UEFI BIOS.</p>
    <p>When provisioning new nodes for an existing Developer Experience Kit deployment with Intel&reg; Software Guard Extensions (Intel&reg; SGX) enabled, Edge Software Provisioner may fail in cases when the Provisioning Certificate Caching Service module has exceeded 24 hours of runtime on an AWS cloud instance. In this case, reset Intel&reg; SGX using the “SGX Factory Reset” option in the BIOS.</p>
    <p><span>Dell PowerEdge R750 servers</span><br>The Trusted Platform Management (TPM) endorsement key is not signed by a known Certificate Authority. The Intel&reg; SecL - DC libraries will fail to verify the endorsement key certificate. The system administrator must provision the root CA certificate of the TPM endorsement key to the host verification service in out-of-band mode.</p>
    <h3>Developer Experience Kit (21.12)</h3>
    <a class="uk-button uk-button-info uk-button-small uk-margin-small-bottom">Added</a>

    <h3>22.01 Updates</h3>
    <p>We are pleased to announce the 22.01 release of Intel&reg; Smart Edge Open software. This release features an updated Private Wireless Experience Kit for CentOS 7.9 that uses Intel&reg; Edge Software Provisioner to automate deployment.</p>
    <a class="uk-button uk-button-info uk-button-small uk-margin-small-bottom">Added</a>
    <p>The <a href="/docs/experience-kits/private-wireless-experience-kit/" title="Intel&reg; Private Wireless Experience Kit">Intel&reg; Private Wireless Experience Kit</a> supports a single orchestration domain, optimizing the edge node to support both applications and NG-RAN and NG-Core network functions such as DU/CU, AMF, SMF, and UPF.</p>
    <p>Autonomous Deployment Through Intel&reg; Edge Software Provisioner (Intel&reg; ESP): Easy provisioning of a multi-node environment with CentOS 7.9. Intel&reg; ESP enables ODMs, system integrators and developers to automate the installation of a complete operating system and software stack on bare-metal or virtual machines using a just-in-time provision process.</p>
    <p>A new SR-IOV FEC operator to configure the Intel&reg; vRAN Accelerator ACC100 Adapter, and a SR-IOV Network Operator to configure the Intel&reg; Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X710-DA4. This replaces the manual process that was needed in the previous version</p>
    <p>Wireless Network Ready Intelligent Traffic Management (ITM) application integration to demonstrate and test the capabilities of the experience kit. Once the application has been deployed on the edge node in a 5G network, the application pod takes in virtual/real RTSP (real time streaming protocol) addresses, performs inference, and sends metadata for each video stream to an InfluxDB database. In parallel, the visualizer overlays the analysis on the metadata, displaying pedestrians detected, collisions observed, and the processed video feed.</p>
    <p>Intel&reg; Ice Lake™ Scalable Processor Support: Support for the Dell EMC PowerEdge&reg; R750 with 3rd Generation Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable Processors</p>
    <a class="uk-button uk-button-warning uk-button-small uk-margin-small-bottom">Known Issues</a>
    <ul>
        <li>Sometimes the Dell R750 edge node hangs during reboot when using an Ethernet card based on Intel&reg; Ethernet Controller XL710. This is because Intel&reg; Ethernet Controller XL710 based Ethernet cards are not in the Dell official support list. We will upgrade the Private Wireless Experience Kit to use an E810 NIC, which is supported by Dell, in the next release.</li>
        <li>5G CNFs - User equipment sometimes fails to reattach when it moves from idle mode to active mode. This issue will be addressed with future 5G Core CNF upgrades.</li>
